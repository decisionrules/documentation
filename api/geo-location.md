# Geo-locations

Content delivery network (CDN), or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. It has an advantage of response time, reliability and availability.

### Our locations

So far, DecisionRules has 3 locations for API Solver, but in the future, we are planning to add more for faster decisions and to decrease the response time for our customers.

The only change you need to make is to change [api.decisionrules.io](http://api.decisionrules.io) to the server you would like to use from the list below.

#### Europe - Ireland

[api.decisionrules.io](http://api.decisionrules.io) = [http://eu1.api.decisionrules.io/rule/solve](http://eu1.api.decisionrules.io/rule/solve)

#### Europe - Stockholm, Sweden

[http://eu2.api.decisionrules.io/rule/solve](http://eu2.api.decisionrules.io/rule/solve)

#### USA - **Virginia**

[http://us1.api.decisionrules.io/rule/solve](http://us1.api.decisionrules.io/rule/solv)

#### USA - North California
