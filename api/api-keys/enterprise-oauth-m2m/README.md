# Enterprise OAuth (M2M)

### Enterprise OAuth Integration: Solver API Key Security

Welcome to the DecisionRules Enterprise OAuth Setup Guide. This documentation outlines the steps required to secure and manage access to your Organization's **DecisionRules Solver API** using industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocols.

#### Purpose

The DecisionRules Solver API processes sensitive business logic and requires machine-level security. To achieve this, we enforce the **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant Flow** (also known as Machine-to-Machine or M2M). This method ensures that all automated service calls are authenticated using secure, short-lived Access Tokens rather than static, long-lived API keys.
