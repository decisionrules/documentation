# Business Intelligence API

The Business Intelligence API is providing the business intelligence functionalities of DecisionRules. Most importantly, it allows to collect data from the rule solver.

## About the Business Intelligence API

The API allows you to get audits from database and delete them from the database when they are no longer needed. We describe both endpoints below.



### Get Audit Logs

This endpoint allows you to fetch audit logs from your rule solver, including metadata of the solver run as well as the input and output data.

{% hint style="info" %}
The rule solver does not generate audit logs by default. If you want some rule to generate audits on each solve, you have to **turn on audit logs** in its Rule Settings. More information can be found on the [Audit Logging](../business-intelligence/audit-logs.md) Page.
{% endhint %}

{% swagger src="../.gitbook/assets/audit-swagger-fixed.json" path="/audit" method="get" %}
[audit-swagger-fixed.json](../.gitbook/assets/audit-swagger-fixed.json)
{% endswagger %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using the **Regional Cloud** version of DecisionRules, read more about API calls [here](../regional-cloud/region-specific-api-urls.md#making-api-calls-on-region-cloud-accounts).
{% endhint %}

#### Request example

```http
URL
https://bi.decisionrules.io/audit?limit=1

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer DOZpz-h6xnOrKGIINlYvkd9hn41pRR3oG6cqH
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to copy paste your own Business Intelligence API Key after `Bearer` . If you do not have it yet, generate your Business Intelligence API Key [in the app](https://app.decisiongrid.io/api-keys).
{% endhint %}

#### BI Key

If you cannot send the Business Intelligence API Key inside the authorization header, you may use the `bi_key` query parameter; e.g. `bi_key=DOZpz-h6xnOrKGIINlYvkd9hn41pRR3oG6cqH`. In that case, the request could look as follows.

```http
URL
https://bi.decisionrules.io/audit?limit=1&bi_key=DOZpz-h6xnOrKGIINlYvkd9hn41pRR3oG6cqH

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
```

If the `bi_key` query parameter is not set, the server will look for the authorization header as described above.

        }
    ]
}
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that anyone with access to a Business Intelligence API Key can also inherently access your Solver keys, as Audit Logs keep record of the Solver key used for the Solver invocation.
{% endhint %}

### Pagination

There can be a lot of audit logs in the database, of course. We therefore enforce a maximum page size, e.g. the number of audit logs that can be returned per one request. The maximum page size is 1.000, which means that you can never get more audits than 1.000 per one call.

#### Page Size

You can choose a custom page size smaller than 1.000 by defining the `page_size` query parameter. For example, if you set `page_size=100`, the API will always return maximum 100 audits per request, no matter how many matching audits there are in the database. If not set, the page size defaults to 1.000.

#### Page

To get more audit logs than those that can fit on one page, you can use the `page` parameter. For example, if you set `page_size=100&page=2`, you will get audits 101 - 200, while a request with `page_size=100&page=3` yields audits 201 - 300. etc. If not set, page defaults to 1 so you get the first page.

#### Limit

You can also specify the total limit on the number of audits by setting the `limit` parameter. If set, the API will never fetch any further audits than that with index equal to the limit. For example, a request with `page_size=100&page=2&limit=150` yields only the audits 101 - 150, while `page_size=100&page=3&limit=150` returns just an empty array of audits because you have exceeded your limit. There is no limit by default.

### Debug Data

If you are collecting debug data, you may choose to include them in your audit logs. This can be done with the `include_debug` query parameter. If set to true via `include_debug=true`, this query parameter tells the server to include debug data in your audit logs, whenever applicable.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more details on debug data and how to collect them, see the [Audit Logging](../business-intelligence/audit-logs.md#debug-data) page.
{% endhint %}

### Filters

The rest of the query parameters work as filters that help you specify the desired audits.

#### Correlation IDs

When calling the [Rule Solver API](rule-solver-api.md), the solver provides the audit log with the so-called correlation ID. This can happen in two distinct ways. If the request to the solver contains the **X-Correlation-Id** header, the value of this header is simply passed to the correlation ID of the audit log. If the request to the solver does not contain such header, the solver generates its own (unique) correlation ID.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that, in both cases, the solver returns the correlation ID in the **X-Correlation-Id** header of the response.
{% endhint %}

The correlation ID can then be used to get the desired audit log related to a particular solver request. This can be done easily by including the `correlation_ids` parameter. It takes an array of correlation IDs separated by a comma, e.g. ., `correlation_ids=af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc,197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9`.

#### Rules

If set, the `rules` parameter limits the audits to those produced by the specified rules. The individual rules are identified by ids separated by comma, i.e., `rules=af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc,197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9`. Moreover, one may further specify the allowed versions for each of the rules by including square brackets with the comma separated list of versions. For instance, `rules=af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc[1,2],197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9` will return audits for rules with id  `af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc` whose version is either 1 or 2 and audits for rules with id `197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9` of any version.

It is also possible to filter solemnly by rule versions. To do that, use the square bracket expression without specifying rule IDs. For instance, `rules=[1,2]` will return audit logs for rules whose version is 1 or 2, no matter the rule ID.

#### Solver Keys

If set, the `solver_keys` parameter limits the audits to those produced by calling rules with the specified Solver API Key. The individual keys are separated by comma.

#### Tags

The `tags` query parameter allows you to filter the audits by tags present on the rules. For the audit to pass the filter, its rule needs to be decorated with **all the tags** specified in the query parameter. The tags are separated by comma. For example, a request with `tags=Pricing,Test` returns only audits from rules decorated by both the <mark style="background-color:green;">**Pricing**</mark> and the <mark style="background-color:purple;">**Test**</mark>** **  tag.

#### Date

The `date_gte` and `date_lte` parameters allow to filter audit logs by date (and time). The former serves as a lower bound on the date of the solve, the latter serves as an upper bound. In other words, audits will match this filter only if they are older than `date_gte` and younger than `date_lte`. When specifying one or both of the parameters, you can choose from a number of supported formats, including ISO 8601 and RFC 2822 Date time. For example:

```
2013-02-08
2013-02
2013-02-08 09
2013-02-08 09:30
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123
2013-02-08 09+07:00
2013-02-08 09Z
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123+07:00
...
6 Mar 17 21:22 UT
d6 Mar 2017 21:22:23 GMT
Mon, 06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 +0000
...
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that special characters have to be URL encoded when passed to the query parameter. Therefore, when writing your date, please replace these characters with their respective codes. We list the most useful characters and their codes below.
{% endhint %}

```
space    %20
:        %3A
+        %2B
```

#### Order

The `order` parameter can take two values, `order=asc` or `order=desc`. It specifies the chronological order of the audits returned. For `order=asc`, the audits are sorted chronologically, starting with the oldest. For `order=desc`, they are sorted chronologically, starting with the latest. By default, the audits are returned in ascending order.

#### Status Codes

If set, the `status_codes` parameter limits the audit logs to those produced with the specified status code. The individual codes are separated by comma. For example, to get logs from rule solves that returned OK, use `status_codes=200`. To get audit logs from rule solves that returned some kind of rule error, use `status_codes=400, 401, 404, 406, 426`. Eventually, to get audit logs from rule solves that returned server error, use `status_codes=500`.

#### Fields

If set, the `fields` parameter describes which fields of the audit logs to return. For example, if we only need the input data of each audit log we can set `fields=inputData`. Every field of audit logs can be filtered like this. If we want multiple fields to return we can separate the definitions with a comma. `fields=inputData, outputData, ruleAlias` - This example would return audit logs with only the input and output data as well as the ruleAlias.

#### Final request example

Finally let us give an example of a request to the Business Intelligence API with a few optional query parameters.

```http
URL
https://bi.decisionrules.io/audit?page_size=100&page=2&tags=Pricing&date_gte=2022-01-01&date_lte=2022-31-12

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer DOZpz-h6xnOrKGIINlYvkd9hn41pRR3oG6cqH
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to copy paste your own Business Intelligence API Key after `Bearer` . If you do not have it yet, generate your Business Intelligence API Key [in the app](https://app.decisiongrid.io/api-keys).
{% endhint %}

The above request will get audit logs from all solver runs in the given time period (year 2022) of all rules with tag <mark style="background-color:green;">**Pricing**</mark> . We specify that the page size is 100 and we want the second page, i.e., we get audits 101 - 200 (if they are in the database, of course).



### Delete Audit Logs

This endpoint allows you to delete audit logs from the database when you no longer need them.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This action results in permanent and irreversible disposal of the deleted audit logs. Please, use it carefully. More information can be found on the [Audit Logging](../business-intelligence/audit-logs.md#deleting-audit-logs) page.
{% endhint %}

{% swagger src="../.gitbook/assets/audit swagger (1).json" path="audit" method="delete" %}
[audit swagger (1).json](<../.gitbook/assets/audit swagger (1).json>)
{% endswagger %}

#### Request example

```http
URL
https://bi.decisionrules.io/audit?limit=1

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer DOZpz-h6xnOrKGIINlYvkd9hn41pRR3oG6cqH
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to copy paste your own Business Intelligence API Key after `Bearer` . If you do not have it yet, generate your Business Intelligence API Key [in the app](https://app.decisiongrid.io/api-keys).
{% endhint %}

The Business Intelligence API Key can be also included in a query parameter instead of the header. In that case, the same request would look as follows.

```http
URL
https://bi.decisionrules.io/audit?limit=1&bi_key=DOZpz-h6xnOrKGIINlYvkd9hn41pRR3oG6cqH

Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
```

Just as in the preceding endpoint, you may also apply filters here. The corresponding query parameters work in the same way.

#### Correlation IDs

The correlation ID can then be used to delete the audit log related to a particular solver request. This can be done easily by including the `correlation_ids` parameter. It takes an array of correlation IDs separated by a comma, e.g. ., `correlation_ids=af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc,197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9`.

#### Rules

If set, the `rules` parameter limits the audit logs to be deleted to those produced by the specified rules. The individual rules are identified by ids separated by comma, i.e., `rules=af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc,197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9`. Moreover, one may further specify the allowed versions for each of the rules by including square brackets with the comma separated list of versions. For instance, `rules=af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc[1,2],197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9` will return audits for rules with id  `af4012bd-d492-92ec-ffa4-31fd2b70b1bc` whose version is either 1 or 2 and audits for rules with id `197d5d5a-f6f7-35de-1afb-dc26237ebfc9` of any version.

It is also possible to filter solemnly by rule versions. To do that, use the square bracket expression without specifying rule IDs. For instance, `rules=[1,2]` will return audit logs for rules whose version is 1 or 2, no matter the rule ID.

#### Date

The `date_gte` and `date_lte` parameters allow to filter audit logs to be deleted by date (and time). The former serves as a lower bound on the date of the solve, the latter serves as an upper bound. In other words, audit logs will match this filter (and will be deleted) only if they are older than `date_gte` and younger than `date_lte`. When specifying one or both of the parameters, you can choose from a number of supported formats, including ISO 8601 and RFC 2822 Date time. (For some examples, see the preceding endpoint.)

#### Status Codes

If set, the `status_codes` parameter limits the audit logs to those produced with the specified status code. The individual codes are separated by comma. For example, to delete logs from rule solves that returned OK, use `status_codes=200`. To delete audit logs from rule solves that returned some kind of rule error, use `status_codes=400, 401, 404, 406, 426`. Eventually, to delete audit logs from rule solves that returned server error, use `status_codes=500`.
