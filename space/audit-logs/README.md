# Audit Logs

The **Audit Logs** page provides a detailed record of all audit logs generated by space rules, allowing users to track and review system activities efficiently. The logs are displayed in a sortable list, which can be organized by rule, creation time, or HTTP status code for easy navigation.

The **Audit Logs** section is part of the **Space module** and provides a searchable, filterable table of all rule execution logs within the current space.

Audit Logs are designed to help:

* Review past rule evaluations
* Track input and output data for each evaluation
* Filter logs by specific rule, version, correlation ID, or date
* Identify patterns, anomalies, or failed evaluations
* Export or delete outdated log data
