# Event Logs

The Event Logs page provides a complete overview of activity within a space. Each log entry captures key details about actions taken in the application, making it easier to monitor changes, track user activity, and maintain transparency.

### Event Logs Table

The event logs table includes:

* **Timestamp** – records when the action took place.
* **Type** – identifies what kind of action occurred (e.g. _Rule_).
* **Event** – specifies the exact change (e.g. _Rule edited_).
* **Resource** – for rule events, this provides a direct link to the affected rule (if the rule still exists) and also allows you to copy the rule ID. For other event types, it shows the name of the affected item (e.g. an API key name).
* **User** – shows the email of the user who performed the action.

### Rule Picker

You can use the rule picker to filter logs by a specific rule. When no rule is selected, the table displays all events for the entire space, giving you flexibility to either drill down into a single rule or see the bigger picture.

This functionality helps teams track who changed what, when, and where, supporting both day-to-day collaboration and long-term audit requirements.
