# Structure Limits

To help you get the best performance from your workspace, we've outlined a set of recommended guidelines. These guidelines are based on our internal benchmarks and real-world usage to ensure your experience remains smooth, responsive, and scalable.

The limits are presented as individual values for clarity, but itâ€™s important to keep in mind that they can interfere with each other.

The individual application components all work together and share system resources. This means that overall performance depends on how these elements are combined.

Think of the application as a **connected environment**. These limits are not strict ceilings, but rather helpful reference points to guide planning and scale confidently. By staying mindful of the overall structure, you can build powerful, flexible spaces that perform well.
