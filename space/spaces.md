  Agile software development often works in end-to-end delivery teams. To
  support this thesis, we plan to create project sites where each team will have

Spaces allow you to work together with your team in DecisionRules and to create the rules together. It's easy and time-efficient to edit or create your rules. :rocket:

### Getting started

After logging in, the rule list is displayed. The active space is shown in the top-left corner. To view its details, click **Space** in the left-hand menu and the **Space Info** screen will open.

The number of spaces depends on[ **the product plan**](https://www.decisionrules.io/pricing/public-cloud)
{% endhint %}

### Change your space

If you want to change your space you are in, click on the Space selector, modal window will show up with your spaces you can choose from.
