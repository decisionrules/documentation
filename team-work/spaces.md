  Agile software development often works in end-to-end delivery teams. To
  support this thesis, we plan to create project sites where each team will have
  its business rules under its management.

# Spaces

Spaces allow you to work together with your team in DecisionRules and to create the rules together. It's easy and time-efficient to edit or create your rules. :rocket:

{% hint style="info" %}
Everyone gets their spaces after signing up in DecisionRules
{% endhint %}

## Spaces you can have :satellite\_orbital:

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of spaces depends on[ **the product plan**](../billing/change-product-plan.md) \*\*\*\*
{% endhint %}

All of our user can co-work on their decision rules, even if they do not have any of the premium plans. Table below shows, how many spaces and space members are included in our plans:

| **Plan**           | Number of spaces | Number of space members |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Trial Free         | 2                | 2                       |
