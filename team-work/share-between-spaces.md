### Clone to Space

Clone rule to selected Space with a new rule ID. This means the original rule and the clone are independent of each other.

### Share with Space

When you share a rule with another space, the rule will be accessible in both the original Space and the one it was shared with. Nevertheless, it is still the same rule. If you change the rule in one Space, the changes will be reflected in the other Space as well.

### Move to Space

The rule will be removed from the original Space to the selected Space. It will keep its rule ID but will no longer be accessible from the original Space.
