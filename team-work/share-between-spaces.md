### Clone to Space

Clone rule to selected Space with another Id. This means the rules are independent of each other.

### Copy to Space

Clone rule to selected Space with the same Id. This means that the rules are interdependent. If I change a rule in one space, the changes will be reflected in the other space.

### Move to Space

Clone a rule to selected Space with the same Id and delete the rule from actual Space.
