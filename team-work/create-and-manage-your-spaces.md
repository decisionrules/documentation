The limit of users guaranteed by the space owner's plan is compared to **the sum of users and the number of unique invitations** in all spaces of that owner

Example:

* You have a medium plan with a user limit of 6
* You are an owner of 2 spaces - space A and space B
* You have 2 unique users (including yourself) in space A
* You have these same users in space B
* So the total number of users in all the spaces you own is 2
* You send 4 more unique invitations to space A. You can continue to invite the same users to space B that you have invited to space A
* However, if you would like to invite another user (that you have not yet invited to space A), you must either remove one of the invitations in space A or upgrade your plan
