# Import Scripting Rule

## Import From File

To import a scripting rule, sign in, then go to **Scripting Rules** item in the sidebar menu. Next, click on ![](<../.gitbook/assets/screenshoteasy-6- (1).png>) button.

#### Next, there are two options:

### 1. Import and create a new one

In this option, a new scripting rule is created after the scripting rule is imported. The new scripting rule will have a **new Rule Id,** and the version will be set to **1**.

1. Select **New rule**.
2. Drop or choose file with rule
3. Click on** Save**.

### 2. Import and override the existing scripting rule

In this option, after importing the rule, the selected rule with the selected version will be **overridden**. The imported rule, in this way, will have the same** Rule Id** and **version **as selected.

1. Select** Existing rule**.
2. Select **Rule **and **Version**.
3. Drop or choose file with rule
4. Click on** Save**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The selected rule with selected version will be **overridden**. This cannot be **undone**. The only option is to [export the rule](../decision-tables/import-and-export-rule/export-decision-table.md) and then re-import it.
