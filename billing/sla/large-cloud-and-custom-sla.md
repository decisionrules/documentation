# Large Cloud & Custom SLA

DecisionRules offers different types of SLA. Community Support, Standard Cloud, Large Cloud, and in case you we are not matching with your expectations, there is also the possibility of the Custom SLA, where we will create SLA individually according to needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Community Support and Standard Cloud SLA are described [here](community-support-and-standard-cloud.md).
{% endhint %}

## Large Cloud

In the table below is described SLA for Large Cloud. Each issue has different severity, this is why there is a difference in response and resolution time. We are here for you in our business hours between 8am and 6pm CET.
