# Community Support & Standard Cloud

DecisionRules offers different types of SLA. Community Support, Standard Cloud, Large Cloud, and in case you we are not matching with your expectations, there is also the possibility of the Custom SLA, where we will create SLA individually according to needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Large Cloud and Custom SLA are explained [here](large-cloud-and-custom-sla.md).
{% endhint %}

## **Community Support**

Through [Github](https://github.com/decisionrules), Community Support enables people the tools they need to contribute to the DecisionRules topics and issues they care about.

## **Standard Cloud**&#x20;

Standard Cloud SLA are described in the table below. Each issue has different severity, this is why there is a difference in response and resolution time. We are here for you in our business hours between 8am and 6pm CET.
