# Warnings & Errors

## Warnings

If the rule is not mapped in the Rule Flow, it will be demarcated by a yellow border with an icon![](../.gitbook/assets/warningerror2.png). If you save a rule with warnings, the state automatically switches to **pending**.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you point to the![](../.gitbook/assets/warningerror2.png), warning information will be displayed.
{% endhint %}

## Errors

Errors are serious mistakes that prevent Rule Flow from being saved. A red border and an icon![](../.gitbook/assets/erroricon.png)appear next to a rule that contains errors.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you point to the![](../.gitbook/assets/erroricon.png), errors information will be displayed.
{% endhint %}

### All types of errors:

* Rule is not connected with input.
* Rule is not connected with output.

To fix this connect all boxes to Input box and Output box.

* The rule is not selected.

To fix this choose a rule into the empty box by clicking![](../.gitbook/assets/selectrule.png)in the sidebar.

* Cannot find rule.

The rule is probably deleted and can no longer be used in Rule Flow.
