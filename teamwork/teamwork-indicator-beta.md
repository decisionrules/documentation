# Teamwork Indicator

### How it works

This functionality allows you to avoid interference between individual editors, therefore it helps to create better user experience.

As soon as you open the rule detail you will see a badge in the navigation next to the name of the rule when someone else is viewing on the same rule.

Badge rotates periodically to show you the cumulative number of users looking at the rule (exept for yourself).

When you hover over the badge, you will see email address of your colleagues currently viewing the rule.

When two or more users are logged in with one account, they will not see each other. Teamwork Indicator only indicates different accounts.
