### Navigating Folders

Clicking the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (261).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button in the app sidebar opens the Folders menu.

Clicking on a Folder selects it and displays the contents on the screen.

### Folders overview screen controls bar

The **View**, **Filter** and **Sort by** selectors help us manage which rules we'd like to display.

The **View** selector lets us choose whether to display only the rules inside our selected Folder or all rules across the entire Space we're currently in.

Using the **Filter** selector, we can define the types of rules to be displayed.

Lastly, the **Sort by** selector controls the ordering of the displayed rules.&#x20;

* Name - Sorts rules in an alphabetical order by name
* Time - Sorts rules from the latest updated rule to the oldest.
* Default - Sorts rules as they appear in the Folder manager.

The controls bar also lets us create new Rules inside the current Folder or import existing Rules into it.
{% endhint %}

### Folders tree controls

#### At the top of the Folders manager you can find four controls icons.

1. The ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png>)/![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (138).png>) Icon Expands/Collapses the Folder structure i.e. Opens/Closes all Folders.
2. The ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (123).png>) Icon creates a new Folder.
3. The ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (211).png>) Icon refreshes the Folder tree incase you want to be sure everything is up to date.
4. And finally the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (257).png>) Icon closes the Folder manager.

#### Right-clicking the items

Right-clicking on Rules and Folders in the Folder manager brings up different context menus.

The context menu for a Rule: ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (255).png>)

The context menu for a File:  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (247).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
The ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (147).png>) Folder works the same as all other Folders except you can't Rename it, Clone it nor Delete it.
{% endhint %}

#### The Search functionality

Underneath the Folders header is a Search input field. Entering characters then filters your rules to show only the ones containing your input.
