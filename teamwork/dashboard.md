# Dashboard

The **dashboard** is the first screen that welcomes you to DecisionRules.io application. It displays the main information and statistics on the **widgets** and **graphs**.

## Space and management dashboard

Each user can have multiple spaces, so the dashboard is separated into 2 parts: information about the whole account and information about the space.

### Space dashboard

It displays the main information and statistics about the space the user is currently in. To display the information of another space, it is necessary to switch the space

### Account dashboard

The account dashboard displays the main information and statistics about the whole user's account. All the API calls information is summed up of all the spaces owned by the user.
