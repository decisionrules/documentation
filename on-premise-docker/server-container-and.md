# Prerequisites

## What will you need

1. Docker desktop \(Windows, macOS\) or Docker engine \(Linux\)
2. Terminal access \(the console of any kind will do, you shouldn't need admin rights\)

## Windows-specific

On Windows 8.1 and above you need to have WSL 2.0 for the docker virtual machine.

## macOS tip

For some reason, docker has better performance if you run it in a virtual environment.
