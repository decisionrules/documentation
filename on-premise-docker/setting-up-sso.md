# Setting up SSO

You can use SSO login in DecisionRules. This functionality is set using the `SAML_ENTRY_POINT` and `SAML_ISSUER` parameters found in the docker-compose configuration file or added to the container before it is started using the command line.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| SAML\_ENTRY\_POINT | identity provider entry point |
| SAML\_ISSUER | issuer string to supply to IdP |

**Saml entry point** is tipically link provided by your IdP for login page that you gonna use when logining in with SSO.

Example: https://devX.okta.com/app/name/HASH/sso/saml

**Saml issuer** could be l√≠nk with hash or just name to identify your SSO. 

Example: okta.com/HASH\_STRING

After this, you can choose and use the SSO option on the login screen.
