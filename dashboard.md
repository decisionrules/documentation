# Dashboard

The **dashboard** is the first screen that welcomes you to DecisionRules.io application. It displays the main information and statistics on the **widgets** and **graphs**. Each user can have multiple spaces, so the dashboard is separated into 2 parts - information about the whole account or just about the space.

### Space dashboard

It displays the main information and statistics about the space the user is currently in.  To display the information of another space, it is necessary to switch the space

* **API calls per period -** displays the number of API calls in the actual billing period and a percentage increase/decrease compared to the last period \(month\).
* **API calls today -** displays today's amount of API calls and a percentage increase/decrease compared to yesterday.

### Account dashboard

The account dashboard displays the main information and statistics about the whole user's account. All the API calls information is summed up of all the spaces owned by the user.
