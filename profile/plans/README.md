# Plans

The **Plans** page provides an overview of all available subscription plans, allowing you to manage and adjust your current plan based on your needs.

### **Available Plans & Billing Periods**

A table displays all currently available plans, including your **current plan**. You can view plans based on your selected **billing period**—either **monthly** or **annually**—using a toggle switch to switch between the two options. Your **next billing date** is also displayed to keep you informed about upcoming charges.

### **Changing Your Plan**

You can select a different plan at any time:

* **Upgrading to a higher-tier plan** – The upgrade takes effect **immediately**, and the new plan features become available right away.
* **Downgrading to a lower-tier plan** – The downgrade will apply **after the current billing period ends**, ensuring you continue to have access to your current plan until the next billing cycle.

Before changing your plan, ensure that all **billing information** is correctly filled out on the **General** page. Required fields, such as billing email, company or name, tax region, and tax ID, must be completed to proceed with any plan change.
