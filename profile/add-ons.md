# Add-ons

The **Add-ons** page allows you to manage additional features that can be enabled on top of your current subscription plan. Add-ons provide extra functionality beyond what is included in your base plan, giving you the flexibility to customize your subscription according to your needs.

### **Available Add-ons**

A list of available add-ons is displayed, showing the description and pricing details for each option.

### **Billing & Requirements**

The cost of any paid add-ons is added to your **subscription fee**, and charges will be reflected in your invoices. Before enabling or disabling add-ons, ensure that your **billing information** is correctly filled out on the **General** page, as it is required for any modifications.
