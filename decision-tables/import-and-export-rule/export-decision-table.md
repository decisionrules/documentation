# Export Decision Table

## Exporting a Rule

You can export the decision table into various formats, including JSON, XLSX, or deprecated formats like XLSX v.1 and CSV.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We strongly recommend using the updated XLSX format instead of the deprecated XLSX v.1 and CSV, as the older versions lack newer functionalities.
{% endhint %}
