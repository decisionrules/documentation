# Table Operations

## Kinds of Table Operations

Decision tables can contain thousands of lines and hundreds of columns, to work with such a rule would not be simple and clear. This is especially true when you want to edit certain values and you have to go through all the rows in the table. Because of that, we have added a couple of small, but useful features that will make your work more efficient, there are:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Filter** ](filter.md)- finds the value in the columns
2. \*\*\*\*[**Sort** ](sort.md)- sorts the values in the column in ascending/descending order
3. \*\*\*\*[**Preset values**](preset-values.md) - set of possible values in which can be in the particular columns
4. \*\*\*\*[**Search** ](search.md)- finds the value in the whole rule (rows)
