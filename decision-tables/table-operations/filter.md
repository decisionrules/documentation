# Filter

The icon of the filter ![](../../.gitbook/assets/filter.png)is on the right-hand corner under each condition or result. It allows you to filter the table based on the values you enter into the filter.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/columnheader.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
At the same time, you can have active filters for more columns.
{% endhint %}

#### Example

Let's show how the filter works on a real rule

![](../../.gitbook/assets/starttable.png)

Set filter of the first **condition** column to "18" and first **result** column to "affluent"

![](../../.gitbook/assets/resultfilter.png)

The result is the only line here matching the filter. If we want all results containing the word affluent, we have to use "**\*affluent**"

![](../../.gitbook/assets/resultfilter2.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Star \(\*\) before or after the word/value does take all the charasters as matching.

**Example:** hello8, hello9 --&gt; filter **hel\*** will return all the values
{% endhint %}
