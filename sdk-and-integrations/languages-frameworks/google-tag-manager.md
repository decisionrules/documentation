# Google Tag Manager

We have prepared a simple demo showing how to set up an integration of DecisionRules with Google Tag Manager. Such integration provides a versatile way of managing the scripts on your website like analytics and other third-party tools with the help of a powerful rule engine.

See the live demo on the [DecisionRules & Google Tag Manager](https://decisionrules.github.io/decisionrules-gtm/) page.

All the files of the demo can be found in our dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/decisionrules/decisionrules-gtm).
