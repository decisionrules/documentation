# Assistant Setup

If you're using the **Docker version** of DecisionRules, you can set up your own AI integration by uploading a model-specific configuration file in **Organization → Settings**. This allows you to connect your own AI provider credentials securely and use the AI Assistant with your own resources.

For users on our **Cloud version**, the AI Assistant is pre-configured and ready to use — no additional setup is required.

**Currently, we only support Gemini, but more AI model options will be available in the future.**
