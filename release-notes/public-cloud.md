It is now possible to view the differences between two scripting rules and edit the primary scripting rule, reflecting the differences in any way you like. This feature will greatly simplify handling conflicts between distinct versions of scripting rules.
* Updated Kafka solver
* Minor bug fixes

### Version 1.15.3 - 5/2023

* Bug fixes
* Changed solver call policy, where you are now able to call rules from the app itself without api keys read permissions.

### Version 1.15.2 - 5/2023

* Columns of Decision Tables are now resizable! Drag and drop the edges of column headers to resize their corresponding columns.
* Improved the search functionality of Decision Tables.

* Minor bug fixes.

### Version 1.15.1 - 4/2023

* Added regional cloud functionality. What are regional clouds? Read more about them [here](broken-reference).
* Minor bug fixes.

### Version 1.15.0 - 3/2023

* Added internationalization and language support.
* Added Czech language.
* Minor bug fixes.
* Minor changes to the Test Bench.

### Version 1.14.5 - 3/2023

* Minor improvement of login & registration.
* Improvement in several functions, namely AND, OR, TEST, SOLVE & the HTTP functions. These now accept null and {} as valid inputs. This further expands their possible usage. **Note that this improvement involves a small change in behavior.**

### Version 1.14.3 - 3/2023

* Bug fix of the Rule Alias field and the Simple JSON editor.
* Bug fix concerning the interpretation of numbers in functions.
* Improvement in the evaluation of empty array. From now on, empty array is considered a valid value and can enter the evaluation of functions. This allows to work with empty array in the context of functions. **This improvement involves a change in behavior.** If there is a chance of passing an empty array as input data in one of your decision tables or decision trees, **please test the respective rule** to make sure the present change does not affect your logic.
* Improvement in the evaluation of the functions EQ, NE and ARRAY\_INCLUDES. These functions now accept null and {} as valid inputs. Thanks to this, you may for example check if a variable equals null. **This improvement involves a change in behavior.**
* New `REDIS_PING_INTERVAL` environment variable that allows to set the duration (in milliseconds) for which the server pings the Redis server.
* Fixed a bug in functions MAX and MIN. For an empty array or a value that cannot be parsed to a number, these now return null. This improvement involves a change in behavior.

### Version 1.14.1 - 2/2023

* Added support for using functional expressions (like functions or variables) inside JSON within functions. Thanks to this, you can freely combine objects, arrays and the DecisionRules functions to introduce custom logic. This is a very powerful tool when using integration functions like SOLVE or for advanced data transformations. [Read more about JSON and functions](../decision-tables/operators/functions/functions-and-json.md).
* Update in the evaluation of variables. We are no longer casting primitive values (e.g. numbers or boolean values) saved within variables to string; instead, we keep their original type. Together with this change, we have improved the ability of several functions to cast their arguments to the type they need for evaluation. Please beware that **this enhancement involves a change in behavior.**
* Multiple minor bug fixes.
* Small improvement in the rule flow designer layout.
* Bug fix in the Management API. Creating rule via Management API now returns an error when the rule with given `ruleId` and `version` already exists.
* Bug fix involving duplicate rule aliases on multiple spaces.
* Improved zoom in decision trees.
* Status of rules is now visible thanks to coloring in the folder menu.

### Version 1.14.0 - 1/2023

* Added folders. You can now organize your rules in folders, edit the folder structure and display rules based on their location. Folders are comfortably accessible in the folder menu.

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BW79jbv5TYtUIXRyGgNOoyFDdsg3u3FlHxyCZVQPiaT5YVduAEgy1tbhK1MlH67EuyjoEHhRvv3gFi1I8KrbNC7RrZLrJHXnXsTT6XRxXikxQMSBic81OZVx6x2rheFIHOQAqpaz7E_-sNIjF_xjUpwZf8SXPA4OibOMS7u9KxvrgG2kOP1IUq4eYmvCLQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Simplified side menu no longer shows rule lists divided according to rule types. You can newly access all rules by following the Business Rules item in the menu. Thanks to its simplicity, the side menu can be now used effectively in the collapsed mode.
* Simplified dialog for creating and importing rules of any type. Rules can be created or imported by clicking the corresponding button in the top right corner of the rule list, or alternatively from the folder menu.
* The user profile now shows the current tariff limits including all add-ons.
* New section Users & Roles allows users to quickly access the space settings.
* Improved design of the rule list. You can now filter rules by types and sort them more easily.
* Font in decision tables and decision trees was changed to monospace for better readability.

### Version 1.13.1 - 12/2022

* Added the [ELSE operator](../decision-tables/operators/general-operators.md#else-else) in decision tables which allows, among other things, to add the so called default row. The ELSE operator returns true if no row has been triggered before so it is useful for defining fallback rows.
* Bug fix involving duplicate rule aliases on multiple spaces of the same user.

### Version 1.13.0 - 12/2022

* Improved hinting for functions, in particular their arguments. You can now see the hint as you write the function.
* Bugfix involving calling of rules in foreign spaces of the same user.
* Bugfix in the interpretation of the backslash character. **This bugfix involves a change in behavior.** Please consult our documentation of [Functions](https://docs.decisionrules.io/doc/decision-tables/functions#values) for details about the current behavior. If you were not using double backslash or backslash in combination with the double or single quotes character, you do not need to worry about this change.
* Bugfix involving the situation in which an input cell of type function is evaluated to a non-boolean value. From now on, such a case will result in an error and the condition will be interpreted as false. **This bugfix involves a change in behavior.** However, it only affects ill-defined rules.
* Enhancement in the behavior of OR function. When a single argument is found to be true, the other values are not validated anymore (they do not even need to be boolean) and the result is automatically casted to true. **This enhancement involves a small change in behavior.**
* New `options` property allowing to configure the rule solver. For a decision table, it is now possible to include or exclude specific condition columns when calling the solver. See the documentation of [Rule Solver API](https://docs.decisionrules.io/doc/api/rule-solver-api) for details.
* Audit is now active in Trial by default so new users can freely test this feature.
* Adjusted message when owner of teammate space does not have activated Audit.
* Added the `ruleAlias` property to all the rules and rule flows. Rule alias works the same way as rule ID but can be edited by the user and is better human-readable. It can be used to refer to rules in other rules as well as in API calls. It stays untouched when the rule is cloned or exported and imported which greatly simplifies manipulation with rules.
* Changing invitation to Space. You can select from users which you have in other spaces now.
* Shrunk cells now have the same width for all columns. This allows for better scrolling of Decision Tables without horizontal jumps.

### Version 1.12.1 - 11/2022

* Bugfix with invite users into space. Now is validation case insensitive.

* Added support for arithmetic operations (,-,/,+,%) in functions, e.g. 1+1.&#x20;
* Functions SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT, MEDIAN, CONCAT, CONCAT\_WS, AND, OR now accept arrays as parameters. Functions EQ and NEQ accept arrays and objects.
* Improved DecisionTable performance on big rules.
* Added new functions hinting in decision tables, decision trees and scripting rules.
