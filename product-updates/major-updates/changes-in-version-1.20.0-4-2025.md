# Changes in Version 1.20.0 (4/2025)

## New Layout. Smarter Navigation. Better Experience.

After years of steady development and growth, our app just received a long-awaited facelift. With a modernized look and a more intuitive structure, navigating and working within the app is now easier and more enjoyable than ever before.

This redesign isn’t just cosmetic—it’s about making your experience smoother, more unified, and easier to grasp at a glance. From consistent buttons and modals to improved structure and smart navigation, every change was guided by best practices in UX design and feedback from users like you.

And this is just the beginning. The layout and user experience will continue to evolve as we fine-tune and improve the interface to better support your daily workflows.

And one of the first big steps forward is the introduction of our [**beta** **AI Assistant**](broken-reference), designed to help you build rules more easily—especially when you’re not sure where to start. Just describe your use case, and the assistant will guide you through the process.

### Clearer Navigation: Main Page vs. Editor Mode

To streamline your workflow, we’ve split the app into two distinct modes, each with its own focus:

### Main Page

This is your hub for managing rules, spaces, and organizations.

* **Top panel now includes:**
  * Space owner
  * Space selector – opens a modal to switch spaces
* **Left panel contains:**
  * Rules – including your full rule list and a new Templates section
  * Spaces – each with its own dashboard
  * Organizations – familiar interface, no major changes
  * Help – fully redesigned (more below)
  * Profile – now shows account dashboard, plan info, invoices, add-ons, and more

#### **What’s New in the Rules Section:**

• **Templates** – jump-start your work with pre-built rule examples for use cases like pricing, catalogues, and segmentation (more coming soon)

• **AI Assistant** – currently supports creating Decision Table rules (more types coming soon)

• **Improved Rule List** – shows more details at a glance (status, alias, tags) and gives you instant access to common actions via a new options menu

### **Editor Mode Page**

When you open a rule, you enter the Editor Mode—a focused space for rule editing.

* **Top panel now includes:**
  * Back button to return to Main Page
  * Rule name + version
  * **Settings / Designer** tab switch
  * Updated **Integrations** modal – shows available code integrations
  * Rule Actions (•••) – clone, export/import, lock, create new version, etc.
  * Control buttons – Undo, Redo, Save
* **Left-side icon panel** opens tools relevant to the rule you’re working on:
  * Folders – with your full rule list to switch between rules with ease
  * Rule-specific options—like Rule variables for Decision Tables, or Palette and Inspect for Workflows—are now accessible from the left-side panel
  * Rule Dependencies – now with its own dedicated section separate from Settings
  * Rule History – moved here for better access
  * Help & Profile – always available at the bottom

#### Most functionality stays the same, with minor visual polish:

• Settings and Designer tabs remain functionally unchanged, with small visual updates for better consistency (colors, buttons, icons)

• Designer’s Control Bar – still includes Test Bench, Console, and key editing tools for your rule type

**Redesigned Help & Info**

Our new Help modal is your one-stop resource for guidance and support.

* Includes **useful links** to documentation, academy, blog, service desk and more
* Shows current **app/system status** (e.g. server or client downtime)
* Always available and context-aware:
  * In a rule? You’ll see rule-related help and shortcuts.
  * In other sections like Organizations or Spaces? You’ll see help on managing users, access, and more.

#### Updated documentation structure

We’ve also restructured our documentation to better reflect the layout of the app. Sections have been reorganized to match the new interface, making it easier to find what you’re looking for and navigate help resources more intuitively.
