# Users management

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is available only in the **Docker / On‑Premise** deployment, and if you are an Environment Manager.
{% endhint %}

If you need access, contact your administrator or our sales team.

### Overview

You get a list of all registered users with their emails and **roles**.

This is the central place for **user administration** in Docker deployments.

### Actions per user

#### Reset password

Resetting the password is a temporary solution.

An environment manager sets a temporary password.

Then the user changes it in their profile.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This applies only to **email/password** users (not SSO).
{% endhint %}

#### Delete user

Deleting a user is permanent.

It deletes all rules, spaces, and organizations of that user.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do this only when you are sure.
{% endhint %}
