# Spaces Migration

Use **Environments → Spaces Migration** to migrate spaces to another organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available only in the **Docker / On‑Premise** deployment, and if you are an Environment Manager.
{% endhint %}

If you need access, contact your administrator or our sales team.

### Overview

You get a list of all spaces in the database.

### What you can migrate

You can migrate:

* Private spaces
* Organization spaces

### What changes after migration

The space inherits the billing owner from the target organization.

Everything else remains unchanged.

Access permissions are not migrated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After migration, you must set up access to the space again.
{% endhint %}
