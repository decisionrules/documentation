# On Premise

In an on-premise environment, the application is deployed and operated within the customer’s infrastructure, typically using Docker containers. User accounts and authentication are managed locally within the customer’s instance.

Depending on the setup, users may sign in using local credentials or Single Sign-On (SSO) integrated with the customer’s authentication system.

The initial administrative user is created as part of the installation and setup process. From there, user access and permissions are managed within the application according to the customer’s internal policies.

The following pages describe common access flows for self-hosted environments, including initial setup, first login, and user management.

### **How can I tell I am using an on-premise installation of DecisionRules?**

You are using an on-premise (self-hosted) installation of DecisionRules if the application is running within your organization’s own infrastructure.

On-premise environments are usually accessed through a custom or internal URL and are typically fully managed by your organization. Available authentication methods are credentials or SSO (if configured).

If you are unsure which installation you are using, contact the person responsible for managing your Decision Rules instance.
