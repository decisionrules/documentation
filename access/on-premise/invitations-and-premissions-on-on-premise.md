# Invitations & Premissions on On Premise

In on-premise installations of DecisionRules, users are invited either to an organization or directly to a space. Invitations are handled internally within the application and are not delivered by email.

### Types of invitations

Decision Rules supports two types of invitations:

* **Organization invitation**\
  Grants access to an organization and its spaces according to assigned roles.

* **Space invitation**\
  Grants access to a specific space with a defined role.

### How invitations work in on-premise environments

When a user is invited:

* No invitation email is sent.
* The invitation is stored inside the DecisionRules application.
* The user must log in or register manually.

After logging in or registering, invitation handling depends on the invitation type.

#### Organization invitations

If a user is invited to an organization:

* The invitation appears in the **Organization** section.
* After acceptance, the user gains access to the organization and related spaces based on assigned roles.

#### Space invitations

If a user is invited directly to a space:

* The invitation is automatically accepted after registration.
* The user gains immediate access to the space.
* Access level is defined by the assigned role.

### Roles and permissions

During invitation, a role is assigned to the user.

Roles define what the user can see and do within an organization or space. Assigned roles can be modified later if needed.

For more information about roles, see:

* Access for private spaces
* Space Roles and Members for organization spaces
