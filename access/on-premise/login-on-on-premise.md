# Login on On Premise

## Login – Accessing Your Account

Existing users can log in using the same methods they registered with:

* **Email & Password** – Enter the credentials you set during registration.
* **SSO** – Choose your organization’s SSO option and follow the redirect.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can set you [SSO in Organization Settings](../../organization/settings.md#single-sign-on-sso) or in [environment setup](../../other-deployment-options/docker-and-on-premise/setting-up-sso/).
{% endhint %}

Once authenticated, you’ll be taken straight to your workspace.
