You represent and warrant that: (i) You have the legal right to use any credit or debit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Order; and that (ii) the information You supply to us is true, correct and complete.

By submitting such information, You grant us the right to provide the information to payment processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Your Order.

#### Order Cancellation

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order at any time for certain reasons including but not limited to:

* Services availability
* Errors in the description or prices for Services
* Errors in Your Order

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.

**Your Order Cancellation Rights**

As our Service is provided on a business-to-business (B2B) basis, the statutory cancellation rights and cooling-off periods applicable to consumer contracts do not apply.

The terms for canceling a Subscription are exclusively governed by the "Subscriptions" and "Termination" sections of this Agreement. Once a Subscription fee has been paid for a specific billing period, it is non-refundable, except as expressly provided in the "Refunds" section or as required by mandatory law.

#### Service Availability and Information

The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Service available to You 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (a) planned downtime (of which We shall give advance notice via the Service or email), and (b) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Our reasonable control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet service provider failure or delay, or denial of service attack.

We strive to ensure that all information on our Website is accurate. However, the definitive and binding description of the Service's functionality and features is exclusively provided in the official Documentation. In the event of any discrepancy between marketing materials on the Website and the Documentation, the Documentation shall prevail. The price applicable to Your Order is the price that was confirmed to You at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to correct any typographical errors or inaccuracies in any information, provided such correction does not materially alter the terms of Your existing Subscription.

#### Prices Policy

Prices for the Service displayed on the Website are for informational and illustrative purposes only and do not constitute a binding offer.

The binding and final price for the Service is the price specified in the individual order form, quote, or order confirmation provided to You by the Company (the "Order"). This price shall remain fixed for the duration of the initial Subscription term specified in the Order.

Any changes to pricing for subsequent renewal terms are governed exclusively by the "Fee Changes" section of this Agreement. All payments are due in the currency specified in the Order, and You are responsible for any applicable taxes, including VAT and any and all fees or costs associated with the payment transaction, including but not limited to bank fees, cross-border transaction fees, and card processing fees.

#### Payments

All Services purchased are subject to a one-time payment. Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa, MasterCard, Affinity Card, American Express cards or online payment methods (PayPal, Stripe, for example).

Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by Your card issuer. If we do not receive the required authorization, We will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of Your Order.

#### Cross-Border Transaction Costs and Payment Terms

In the event of any cross-border transaction costs (i.e., bank and wire transfer fees) or if the Client is required by any applicable domestic or foreign law or regulation to withhold or deduct a portion of the payments, the amount payable to the Contractor shall be increased by the amount necessary for the Contractor to receive an amount equal to the amount it would have received if no withholdings or deductions had been made. The parties will cooperate in good faith to minimize any adverse tax consequences from cross-border transactions. The wire transfer must be made by the Client with the “OUR” option, which means that the transfer fees are expected to be paid before the transfer initiation, so the fees are paid by the Client. The prices in this Order Form are final, excluding tax, which will be handled on each side separately. For the Czech Republic, VAT is 21%.

#### Tax Exemption and Price Guarantee Clause for Non-EU Clients

All transactions conducted with clients located outside the European Union (EU) are exempt from VAT (Value Added Tax) and any other applicable EU taxes. Clients must provide appropriate proof of their location outside the EU to qualify for this exemption. This tax exemption applies to all products and services offered by our company and is in accordance with applicable tax regulations. Furthermore, any withholding tax or similar levies imposed by non-EU jurisdictions shall not affect the final price to be received by the recipient. The client is responsible for any such taxes, and the amount payable to the recipient must be made in full, without deductions. This ensures that the recipient receives the full agreed price, irrespective of any tax obligations in the client's country.

### Subscriptions

#### Subscriptions

The Service is offered on a paid subscription basis (a "Subscription"). By purchasing a Subscription, You gain the right to access and use the Service in accordance with the plan You select for a defined term (the "Subscription Term").

Unless specified otherwise in Your Order, Your Subscription will automatically renew for successive periods equal in length to the original Subscription Term, unless either party gives the other written notice of its intent not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.

You may cancel the automatic renewal of Your Subscription at any time through Your Account settings page or by providing written notice to the Company. To be effective for the upcoming renewal, such notice must be provided in accordance with the notice period set forth in the preceding paragraph. Upon such cancellation, Your Subscription will remain active until the end of the then-current Subscription Term, and You will not be charged for any subsequent terms.

As stated in our Refunds, fees for the current, active Subscription Term are non-refundable.

#### Billing

You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, company ID number, and a valid payment method information.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

#### Fee Changes

The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.

The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

#### Refunds

Due to the business-to-business nature of our Service, all fees are non-refundable. This includes, but is not limited to, fees for the initial Subscription Term, any renewal terms, and any unused portion of the Service if You choose to cancel Your Subscription before the end of the term.

The Company is not obligated to provide any refunds or credits for partial Subscription periods or unused time. This non-refundable policy shall apply at all times, except where mandatory applicable law provides otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, choose to offer a refund, discount, or credit in specific instances on a case-by-case basis. Any such refund shall be subject to deductions for transaction costs, payment processing fees (e.g., from Stripe or other providers), or any other unrecoverable costs incurred by the Company in connection with the original payment or the refund itself. The final refund amount will be the net amount after all such deductions Any such decision shall not be construed as a waiver of this policy or establish any precedent for future requests.

<br>

#### Free Trial

The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited period of time.

You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged by the Company until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless You canceled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.

At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
