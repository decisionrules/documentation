## Accessing Comparison

Only users subscribed to the Large plan and above can benefit from the rule comparison feature.

Only rules of the same type can be compared to each other (i.e. Tables to Tables, Scripts to Scripts).&#x20;

To enter the rule comparison view, right-click on a rule in the Folders menu and choose 'Compare'.

You can also find the same option under each rules' settings or after clicking the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (270).png>)  on a rule in the 'Business Rules' menu.

You will be presented with a pop-up screen where the Original rule will have been filled in with the rule you triggered comparison on. Next you should choose which rule to compare the Original rule to (i.e. choose the Reference rule).&#x20;

After choosing the reference rule, click the Compare button.
