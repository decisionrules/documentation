# Common Rule Features

All rule types share a set of fundamental properties and features that define their behavior, lifecycle, and execution. Understanding these common elements helps ensure consistency when managing and configuring rules across different spaces.

Key shared properties include the **rule alias**, which provides a unique identifier for a rule, and **versioning**, allowing you to track and manage different iterations of a rule. The **test bench** enables testing rules in isolation before deployment, while the **rule status** determines whether a rule is active, inactive, or in draft mode. **Rule variables** allow dynamic data handling within rules, and the **execution strategy** defines how rules are evaluated. Additionally, the **rule comparison** feature helps analyse differences between rule versions, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. Finally, rules interact with data through the **input and output model**, defining the structure of the data processed during execution.
