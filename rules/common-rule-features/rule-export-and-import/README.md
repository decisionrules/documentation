# Rule Export & Import

The **rule export and import** functionality allows you to transfer rules between spaces by saving them as files. This feature ensures efficient rule management, making it easier to back up, migrate, or share rules.

Rules are exported and imported primarily in **JSON format**, preserving all rule properties and configurations. For **decision tables**, an additional format is supported—**XLS/XLSX**—allowing for a structured, spreadsheet-based representation of rule data. When exporting, the system generates a file containing all relevant rule details. When importing, you can upload a JSON or XLS(X) file to restore or apply a rule in a different space, ensuring consistency across environments.

This documentation section includes detailed guides on how to **export and import rules**, providing step-by-step instructions to help you manage rule transfers efficiently.
