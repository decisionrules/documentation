# Rule Export & Import

The rule export and import functionality allows you to transfer rules by saving them as files. This is useful for:

* Backing up rules as files.
* Editing rule tables in Excel before importing.
* Sharing rules with external parties who don't have access to your space.
* Migrating rules across different environments or instances.

#### **Supported Formats**

The available export/import formats depend on the rule type:

| Rule Type        | JSON | XLSX | CSV |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Decision Table   | ✅    | ✅    | ❌   |
| Decision Tree    | ✅    | ❌    | ❌   |
| Scripting Rule   | ✅    | ❌    | ❌   |
| Decision Flow    | ✅    | ❌    | ❌   |
| Integration Flow | ✅    | ❌    | ❌   |
| Lookup Table     | ✅    | ✅    | ✅   |
| Rule Flow        | ✅    | ❌    | ❌   |

#### **Alternative: Cross-Space Rule Sharing**

**For direct space-to-space transfers:** If you need to share a rule to another space and you are a member of both spaces, you can use the **Share with Space** button. This allows you to directly share the same rule to another space instantly, without exporting and importing files.
