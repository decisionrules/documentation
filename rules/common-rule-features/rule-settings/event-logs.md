# Event Logs

Event Logs provide a detailed record of actions related to a specific rule, showing what changed, who performed the action, and when. This gives you full visibility into the rule’s history.

You can access Event Logs either from **Space → Event Logs** (to view activity across the entire space or filter by rule) or directly from an individual rule. In the **Rule Settings panel,** the _Inspect Event Logs_ button takes you to the Event Logs page with that rule already preselected.&#x20;
