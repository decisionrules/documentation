# Input & Output JSON Model

There are two options on how to define the input and output of the decision table:

* [Simple Editor](simple-editor.md): It is understood that some of our users may not understand JSON objects' structure. Therefore, we allow non-technical users to create input and output objects using our simple tool, which creates the necessary structures.
* [JSON Editor](json-editor.md): This is an editor for users who have experience with JSON objects' structure.
