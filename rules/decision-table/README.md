# Decision Table

Welcome to the Decision Tables section, the most popular tool within [DecisionRules](https://decisionrules.io/). This section provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively utilize this powerful feature for creating business tables.

### What Is a Decision Table?

A **decision table** is a structured way to represent business logic using conditions and corresponding outcomes. Each row in the table represents a **scenario** — a specific combination of input values that leads to a defined output.

### What will you find in the section?

Here, you'll find detailed instructions on using the table designer, which is the dedicated area for designing tables. Additionally, this section covers the import and export options for rules, as well as how to manage this data seamlessly.

Furthermore, you’ll discover advanced functionalities, including the various functions available for evaluating cells within tables.
