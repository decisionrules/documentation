# Data Types & Functions

Rules rely on various **data types, operators, and functions** to process and evaluate information effectively. Understanding these core elements is essential for defining conditions, performing calculations, and transforming data within rules.

This section provides an overview of the **supported data types**, which include numbers, text, booleans, dates, arrays, and objects. It also introduces **operators and functions**, which are categorized into different groups such as mathematical, logical, text, date, integration, data, and array functions. These functions allow for complex rule execution, enabling dynamic decision-making and data manipulation.

Detailed pages in this section explain each **data type, operator, and function category**, helping you apply them efficiently in your rules.
