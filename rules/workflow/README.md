# Workflow

Workflow is a brand new feature brought in version 1.19.0 of DecisionRules. It allows to design complex decisioning processes. It can be used to orchestrate other rules, make data transforms and calculations, run inline scripts, perform conditional branching, call external API, and more. The list is not final. Workflow will be given even more capabilities in the future, like DB connectors, integrations to 3rd party tools, etc.

## Workflow Features

Looking at its versatility and potential, workflow can be considered a whole new feature category within the DecisionRules universe. After all, with workflow in its repertoire, DecisionRules are gaining some of the major capabilities of a workflow engine. On the other hand, from the user's perspective, workflow fits perfectly into the same picture as other rules. It is listed as an item in the folder structure, it has the same settings, and it has a designer tab for editing the workflow.

Like its predecessor, the [Rule Flow](../rule-flow/), workflow is built by placing boxes on canvas and connecting them with lines. The boxes are called nodes (as in a graph), and the lines are called connections. Unlike in rule flow, there are numerous types of nodes, and the connections also have slightly different meaning, which will be explained on following pages.
