# Decision Tree

Decision Trees allow you to build your decision making logic in a simple tree structure. That means, given input data, you can make and branch out conditions that gradually lead towards the desired output.

It is a visual representation of business rules that uses **IF-THEN-ELSE** logic to map out decision-making processes. It allows users to define conditions and actions step-by-step, making it easy to create both simple and complex decision structures. The design process is made simple thanks to our clear graphical representation.
