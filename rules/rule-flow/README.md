# Rule Flow

**Rule Flow** is a powerful tool rule that allows you to visually connect and orchestrate multiple decision rules—such as Decision Tables, Scripting Rules, Decision Trees, and even other Rule Flows—into a single, cohesive logic process.

#### What Rule Flow Enables

* **Modular Logic Design**: Break down complex decisions into smaller, reusable rule blocks that can be linked together visually.
* **Sequential Rule Execution**: Control the order in which rules are evaluated, allowing for multi-step decision processes.
* **Dynamic Data Handling**: Pass data between rules using input/output mappings to create flexible, context-aware workflows.

#### Key Features

* **Visual Rule Flow Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface for building workflows from existing rules.
* **Data Mapping Between Rules**: Define how data moves through the flow, enabling seamless input/output chaining.
* **Nested Rule Flows**: Use one Rule Flow inside another to keep your logic organized and scalable.
* **Import & Export**: Share Rule Flows easily via JSON, allowing for versioning, backup, and team collaboration.
