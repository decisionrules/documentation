# Rule Flow

**Rule Flow** is a powerful tool rule that allows you to visually connect and orchestrate multiple decision rules—such as Decision Tables, Scripting Rules, Decision Trees, and even other Rule Flows—into a single, cohesive logic process.

### **Try Decision Flow**

While **Rule Flow** lets you connect and execute rules in a simple flow, **Decision Flow** takes this further, giving you more power, flexibility, and possibilities.

With Decision Flow, you can:

* Orchestrate multiple rules in one flow
* Perform data transformations and calculations
* Run conditional logic, inline scripts, or external API/DB calls
* Access more node types and advanced connections

**Why Decision Flow is better:**

* **More versatile:** supports a wider variety of decision scenarios
* **Dynamic and powerful:** can handle complex logic easily

#### Convert Rule Flows to Decision Flows

You can easily convert your existing Rule Flows to Decision Flows using the **Rule Flow Converter**. This allows you to take advantage of all the advanced features of Decision Flow while keeping your existing logic.

#### What Rule Flow Enables

* **Modular Logic Design**: Break down complex decisions into smaller, reusable rule blocks that can be linked together visually.
* **Sequential Rule Execution**: Control the order in which rules are evaluated, allowing for multi-step decision processes.
* **Dynamic Data Handling**: Pass data between rules using input/output mappings to create flexible, context-aware workflows.

#### Key Features

* **Visual Rule Flow Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface for building workflows from existing rules.
* **Data Mapping Between Rules**: Define how data moves through the flow, enabling seamless input/output chaining.
* **Nested Rule Flows**: Use one Rule Flow inside another to keep your logic organized and scalable.
* **Import & Export**: Share Rule Flows easily via JSON, allowing for versioning, backup, and team collaboration.
