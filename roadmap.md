### Q3 2021

  * Filter, order by, and search functions over decision tables in the application to a better overview and edit the tables.
* **Basic Management API - **<mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>
  * Management API allows making operation with spaces/rules even without a need of using UI of DecisionRules, such as retrieve the rule lists with the appropriate information.

  * Editing, adding or deleting more rows in the table at the same time.
