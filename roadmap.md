{% endhint %}

### Q3 2024 <mark style="color:purple;">In Progress</mark>

#### Workflow

We will release a brand new rule type ‚Äì the workflow ‚Äì which will allow you to easily build complex flows of rules with support for branching, external API calls, in-rule scripting, possibility to call other rules with different strategies, data transformations, and much more.

#### Calculation Columns

We will enrich the decision table with calculation columns so that you can perform custom calculations anywhere in the table, even in the conditions section.

Likewise, the admin will be able to manage the organization spaces and control the permissions of the members for the individual spaces.

#### Folders API <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We will provide new endpoints for the Management API dedicated to managing folders. You will be able to perform all the basic CRUD operations over folders, and manage rules in the folder structure via the new API endpoints. These will naturally expand the Management API capabilities to folders and enable you to perform complex rule migrations.

#### Portuguese Translation <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We are constantly trying to improve our accessibility for the international audience. After English and Spanish, we will provide a translation of the whole app to Portuguese. Fique atento!

### Q4 2023 <mark style="color:green;">Delivered</mark>

We will enable to authenticate your calls to the Solver API via OAUTH as a more secure alternative to API Keys.

#### Dictionary <mark style="color:purple;">**Postponed**</mark>

We will introduce a new type of rule which will allow the user to set up a collection of constant values to be used in other rules within the space. These values will be easily editable and accessible. You will be able to use dictionary for storing configurations or as a simple lookup table.

#### Decision Tree Differences <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We will add the functionality of comparing two decision trees. The user will be able to see the tree differences, merge the content from the secondary tree or edit the primary tree arbitrarily. This feature will greatly simplify handling conflicts between distinct versions of decision trees.

#### Rule Lock <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

Lately, our customers have been asking us about a way to lock an important / production rule to protect it from change or deletion. We will implement this feature for you. There will be special permissions needed for managing the lock, so you can easily prevent some users from editing the locked rules.

#### Custom Logo Branding <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

You can have the application show the logo of your company instead of the default DecisionRules logo. This is the first step of our custom branding, which will allow you to choose the logo, colors and types matching your company's visual identity. Available only for on-premise or private (managed) cloud solutions.

#### JS SDK Update <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We will update our most used SDK to include the newest API endpoints, be aligned with the documentation and covered by automatic unit tests.

### Q3 2023 <mark style="color:green;">Delivered</mark>

#### Decision Table Differences <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We will add the functionality of comparing two decision tables. The user will be able to see the table differences, merge the content from the secondary table or edit the primary table arbitrarily. This feature will greatly simplify handling conflicts between distinct versions of decision tables.

#### Decision Tree Differences <mark style="color:purple;">**Postponed**</mark>

We will add the functionality of comparing two decision trees. The user will be able to see the tree differences, merge the content from the secondary tree or edit the primary tree arbitrarily. This feature will greatly simplify handling conflicts between distinct versions of decision trees.

We will let you know who is currently viewing the same rule as you. This will help you organize your teamwork and prevent problems stemming from mutual interference of rule editors.

#### Dependencies <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We will allow users to view and search dependencies of all types of rules. Thanks to this, you will be able to quickly and easily see all the rules that enter a given process. The dependency search will also help when performing group operations over rules, e.g. to check whether a given operation does not break your process. The functionality will be available both in the app and via Management API.

#### Folder Export & Import <mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

Have you ever wondered why you cannot export multiple rules at once? Well, we will bring this capability soon. You will be able to export the whole folder with all its rules to a single file and import it back. This way, you will be able to simply create backup files or share rules between spaces or even environments with one click.

### Q2 2023 <mark style="color:green;">Delivered</mark>

Thanks to this, you may now use DecisionRules as a service while still keeping aligned with your data residency policy.

#### **Scripting Rule Diffs **<mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We added the functionality of comparing two scripting rules. It is now possible to view the differences between two scripting rules and edit the primary scripting rule, reflecting the differences in the way you like. This feature will greatly simplify handling conflicts between distinct versions of scripting rules. Similar rule comparison features are planned for decision tables and decision trees.

#### **Languages **<mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We added support for languages and provided translations into Czech and Spanish.

#### **Rule Alias Support **<mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>

We will add support for using rule alias instead of rule ID within Management API. Thanks to this, you will be able to use rule aliases for most operations concerning rules. Together with this, we will make a general revision of security and effectiveness within the business logic treating rules and spaces.

### Q1 2023 <mark style="color:green;">Delivered</mark>

#### **Folders in spaces **<mark style="color:green;">**Delivered**</mark>
