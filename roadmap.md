# Roadmap üö≤ üó∫Ô∏è

## What is the roadmap about?

This section will inform you about our future intention of making DecisionRules.io even a better application for your use adding new features regularly.

{% hint style="success" %}
Some of the features don't have to meet the dates we set. It can be added sooner or later. We aim to always focus on the most important things and customer needs.
{% endhint %}

### Q1 2023 <mark style="color:yellow;">-</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">In Progress</mark>

*   **Folders in spaces - **<mark style="color:green;">**Delivered in SaaS version, Docker version in progress**</mark>

    We will bring better organization of rules using folders for larger spaces. We would  like to enable user and automated transfer of folders between spaces or individual physically separated environments.
*   **Comparison of rule versions - **<mark style="color:purple;">**In Progress**</mark>

    Functionality that many of our customers are asking for. We will allow you to compare the individual versions of the rules graphically.
*   **Include or Exclude DecisionTable columns in Solver API **<mark style="color:green;">**- Delivered**</mark>

    Our customers requested the possibility of specifying which conditions columns will be activated when calling a decision table via the Rule Solver API. It is now possible to include or exclude columns, making the solve of decision table even more flexible. [https://docs.decisionrules.io/doc/api/rule-solver-api#options](https://docs.decisionrules.io/doc/api/rule-solver-api#options)
*   **Dynamic JSON in Decision Tables and Decision Trees - **<mark style="color:purple;">**In Progress**</mark>

    We would like to make decision tree nodes collapsible to improve the overall experience when editing decision trees.
*   **Simplifying the migration of rules between spaces / environments using folders**

    Migration of rules is a big topic for us lately. So far, one can only manage single rules via Management API. We would like to enable to use folders as migration packages, so the user could migrate all rules in one folder or even in one space at once.
