# Roadmap üö≤üó∫Ô∏è

## What is the roadmap about?

This section will inform you about our future intention of making DecisionRules.io even a better application for your use adding new features regularly.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some of the features don't have to meet the dates we set. It can be added sooner or later. We aim to always focus on the most important things and customer needs.
{% endhint %}

### Q3 2021

* **Rule Flow**
  * This feature will provide an ability to put rule after rule to make a "chain," which will be executed as one rule made of more.
* **Downloadable Docker containers**
  * If you don't want to use our web app, you can download and configure the Docker container in your environment.
* **Decision Tables operations**
  * Filter, order by, and search functions over decision tables in the application to a better overview and edit the tables.
* **Basic Management API key**
  * Management API keys allow making operation with spaces/rules even without a need of using UI of DecisionRules, such as retrieve the rule lists with the appropriate information.
* **Mass operations over the rules**
  * Editing, adding or deleting more rows in the table at the same time.

### Q4 2021

* **Advanced permissions**
  * Ability to assign permissions to the user within the space. Permissions will be granular, so creating your own sets of permissions will be available.
* **Bulk decision making**
  * Evaluate more rules simultaneously, for example sending 100 inputs, and the output will be for the same amount as input was.
* **User profile**
  * Read and edit the mode of user profiles, adding a profile picture and additional information. Read/edit options.
* **Education videos**
  * Guide/how-to videos alongside our documentation.
* **Rule flow - smaller features**
  * Export/import rule flow, sharing in between the spaces, graphical changes, connecting rule flows through more space,...
* **Demo application**
  * Real application to demonstrate how DecisionRules work in a real environment.
* **Realtime notifications**
  * Notifications in the application for space invitation, rule change monitoring and notification, and more.

### Q1/Q2 2022

* **Advanced dashboard statistics**
* **GeoClusters**
* **Audit log**
* **Monitoring log**
* **Advanced management API **
* **Rules Library**
  * Each rule made by the user can be saved in the library. Those rules will be able within the space regarding permissions. It can be helpful for rules which are used more often, for example, client validation.
* **Decision Trees**
  * The new structure of decision trees will make your rule to edit process easier and faster because of a tree structure.
