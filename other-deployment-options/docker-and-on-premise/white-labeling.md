# White Labeling

Currently, you can set your own brand logo programmatically using the BRAND\_LOGO\_URL [environment variable](containers-environmental-variables.md#optional-server-environment-variables).&#x20;

More advanced white labeling options — such as colors — are coming soon.

## Custom Brand Logo

**Recommended format:**

* SVG (preferred for best scalability and quality)

**Size and layout tips:**

* The logo will be displayed within a fixed space of 160×35 pixels (width × height).
* Avoid adding padding or empty space around the logo. This ensures it fills the available area properly.
* Your image will be automatically scaled up or down to fit the space without distortion.

Using a well-optimized SVG without extra spacing will make your brand look sharp and clean across all devices.
