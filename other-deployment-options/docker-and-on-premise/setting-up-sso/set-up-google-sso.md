# Set up Google SSO

**Create custom SAML Application**

In the Google admin portal navigate to **Apps** -> **Web and mobile apps** -> **Add app -> Add custom SAML app**.&#x20;

### App details

Once there choose a name for the app and optionally a description and icon. Click on Continue

### Google Identity Provider details

In the next step, you will see the SSO URL, Entity ID and Certificate. From these values, save the **SSO URL** and **Certificate** that we will need later. Click Continue.

### Service provider details

In the next step, set the necessary information and save it for later.

* For the **Entity ID** you can put in any easily identifiable name.
* For the **ACS URL** put the address of your server (API) container with "/saml/callback" following.&#x20;
  * example: "_https://api.sandbox.decisionrules.io/saml/callback"_
* For the **Name ID format** choose **EMAIL**
* For the **Name ID** choose **Basic Information > Primary email**
